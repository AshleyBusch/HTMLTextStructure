     <h2>Music Can Change Your LIFE</h2>
       <p>I know that music has always been a big part of my life, and <br>
          I want other people to find great ways to experience music <br>
          and discover the impact it could have on their lives. There are <br>
          so many ways music can help you. Whether it's in your daily <br>
          life, or helping you through a tough spot in life, it always <br>
          has a way of putting things into perspective.</p>
